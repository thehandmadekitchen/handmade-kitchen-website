notes: "One Pan Wonder: Everything cooks together! Minimal cleanup. Make It Healthier: Use brown rice (add 15 minutes cooking time and 1/2 cup more broth). Make Your Own Cream Soup: Melt 3 tbsp butter, stir in 3 tbsp flour, add 1 cup milk. Way better! Veggie Flexibility: Use whatever frozen vegetables you have - peas, carrots, green beans, corn. Leftover Magic: This reheats beautifully! Make Sunday, eat Monday-Tuesday. Freezer-Friendly: Freeze before baking. Thaw overnight, bake as directed."
