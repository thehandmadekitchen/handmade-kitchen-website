prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "0 minutes"
total_time: "15 minutes"
servings: "24 bites"
ingredients:
  - "2 large English cucumbers"
  - "1/2 cup hummus or cream cheese"
  - "1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, quartered"
  - "1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese"
  - "2 tablespoons Kalamata olives, chopped"
  - "Fresh dill for garnish"
  - "Olive oil for drizzling"
  - "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
  - "Slice cucumbers into 1/2-inch thick rounds. You should get about 24 slices."
  - "Use a small spoon to scoop out seeds from center of each cucumber slice, creating a small well. Don't scoop too much - leave enough for stability."
  - "Pat cucumber rounds dry with paper towel."
  - "Spread or pipe a small amount of hummus or cream cheese onto each cucumber round."
  - "Top each with cherry tomato pieces, feta crumbles, and chopped olives."
  - "Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and garnish with fresh dill."
  - "Arrange on a platter and serve immediately!"
notes: "Make Ahead: Prep cucumber bases and toppings separately. Assemble 1-2 hours before serving to prevent sogginess. Why English Cucumbers?: They have fewer seeds and thinner skin, making them perfect for this recipe! Variations: Try different toppings! Smoked salmon and cream cheese, avocado and cherry tomato, or goat cheese and honey. Party Perfect: These are naturally gluten-free and low-carb, making them perfect for guests with dietary restrictions. Storage: Best eaten same day. The cucumbers will release water if stored overnight."
