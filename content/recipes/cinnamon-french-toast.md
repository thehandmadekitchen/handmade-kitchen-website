prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "15 minutes"
total_time: "25 minutes"
servings: "8 slices"
ingredients:
  - "8 slices thick bread (challah or Texas toast work best)"
  - "4 large eggs"
  - "1 cup milk"
  - "2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
  - "1 teaspoon cinnamon"
  - "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg"
  - "Butter for cooking"
  - "Toppings: maple syrup, fresh berries, powdered sugar"
instructions:
  - "In a shallow bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, honey, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg."
  - "Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter."
  - "Dip each bread slice in egg mixture, letting it soak for 10 seconds per side. Don't oversoak or it gets soggy!"
  - "Place soaked bread on hot griddle. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown."
  - "Repeat with remaining slices, adding more butter as needed."
  - "Serve hot with maple syrup and toppings!"
notes: "Freezer Instructions: Let cooked French toast cool completely. Stack with parchment paper between slices. Freeze in freezer bag for up to 3 months. To reheat: Microwave 30 seconds or toast in toaster! Bread Matters: Day-old bread works better than fresh - it absorbs egg mixture without falling apart. Make It Special: Top with whipped cream, caramelized bananas, or berry compote for weekend brunch! Dairy-Free: Use almond milk and coconut oil instead of milk and butter. Meal Prep Hero: Make on Sunday, freeze, grab for quick breakfast all week!"
