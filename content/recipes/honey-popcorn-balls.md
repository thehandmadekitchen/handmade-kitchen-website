cook_time: "10 minutes"
total_time: "20 minutes"
servings: "12 balls"
ingredients:
  - "10 cups popped popcorn (about 1/3 cup kernels)"
  - "1/2 cup honey"
  - "1/4 cup coconut oil or butter"
  - "1/4 teaspoon salt"
  - "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"
instructions:
  - "Pop popcorn and pour into a very large bowl. Remove any unpopped kernels!"
  - "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Grease your hands with coconut oil or butter."
  - "In a saucepan, combine honey, coconut oil, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly."
  - "Boil for 2 minutes without stirring. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla."
  - "Immediately pour hot mixture over popcorn. Working quickly, stir with a greased spoon to coat all popcorn."
  - "Let cool for 2-3 minutes until cool enough to handle (but still warm)."
  - "With greased hands, quickly shape popcorn into balls (about tennis ball size). Press firmly!"
  - "Place on prepared baking sheet. Let cool completely before eating or wrapping."
notes: "Timing is Key: Work quickly! The mixture hardens as it cools. Fun Additions: Mix in M&Ms, peanuts, or dried fruit before shaping. Color Fun: Add natural food coloring to the honey mixture for colored popcorn balls! Storage: Wrap individually in plastic wrap. Keep at room temperature for 3 days. Halloween Perfect: Make orange and black popcorn balls for trick-or-treaters! Pro Tip: Really grease your hands well, or wear plastic gloves sprayed with oil!"
