notes: "Spice Level: This is mild! Add red pepper flakes or cayenne for heat. Make It Vegetarian: Use chickpeas or tofu instead of chicken. Add vegetables like cauliflower and bell peppers. Meal Prep Star: Makes great leftovers! Flavors develop even more overnight. Serve With: Naan bread, rice, or cauliflower rice for low-carb. Freezer-Friendly: Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight and reheat gently. Kid-Friendly: The coconut milk makes it creamy and slightly sweet - kids usually like it!"
