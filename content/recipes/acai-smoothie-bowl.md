notes: "The Secret to Thickness: Use frozen fruit and minimal liquid! It should
  be thick enough to eat with a spoon. Where to Find Acai: Frozen section at
  health food stores or order online. Or substitute frozen blueberries! Topping
  Ideas: Get creative! Sliced banana, berries, granola, almond butter drizzle,
  bee pollen, cacao nibs, coconut. Make It a Meal: Add protein powder or Greek
  yogurt to the blend for more protein. Cost Savings: Juice bar bowl = $12.
  Homemade = $3. Make your own! Instagram Perfect: Arrange toppings in rows or
  patterns for beautiful presentation."
