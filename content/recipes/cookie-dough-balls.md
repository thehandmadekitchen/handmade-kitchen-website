  - "Add chickpeas, almond butter, honey, almond flour, vanilla, and salt to a food processor."

  - "Transfer to a bowl and fold in chocolate chips."
  - "Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm up (makes rolling easier)."

Texture Perfect: Make sure to blend really well - it should look and feel like cookie dough! No chickpea chunks. Flavor Variations: BIRTHDAY CAKE: Add sprinkles instead of chocolate chips. PEANUT BUTTER CUP: Roll in cocoa powder after forming balls. DOUBLE CHOCOLATE: Add 2 tablespoons cocoa powder to the mixture. Make Ahead: These are perfect for meal prep! Make a batch on Sunday for healthy desserts all week. Freezer-Friendly: Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw for 10 minutes before eating. Kid-Approved: Even picky eaters love these!
