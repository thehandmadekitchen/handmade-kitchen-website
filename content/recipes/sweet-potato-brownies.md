prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "25 minutes"
total_time: "40 minutes"
servings: "16 brownies"
ingredients:
  - "1 cup mashed sweet potato (about 1 large sweet potato)"
  - "1/2 cup natural almond butter"
  - "1/3 cup honey or maple syrup"
  - "2 eggs"
  - "1/3 cup cocoa powder"
  - "1/4 cup almond flour"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
  - "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
  - "1/4 teaspoon salt"
  - "1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F and line an 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper."
  - "Pierce sweet potato with a fork and microwave for 5-7 minutes until soft. Let cool, then peel and mash until smooth (or use pre-cooked sweet potato)."
  - "In a large bowl, mix sweet potato, almond butter, honey, eggs, and vanilla until smooth and creamy."
  - "Add cocoa powder, almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir until just combined - don't overmix!"
  - "Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle chocolate chips on top if using."
  - "Bake for 20-25 minutes until edges are set but center is still slightly soft (they'll firm up as they cool)."
  - "Let cool completely in the pan before cutting into 16 squares."
notes: "Meal Prep: Bake on Sunday and store in an airtight container for easy lunchbox treats all week. They freeze beautifully too! Storage: Keep in fridge for up to 5 days or freeze for 3 months. Pro Tip: Let them cool completely before cutting for cleaner squares. If they're too soft, pop them in the fridge for 30 minutes first!"
