notes: "Meal Prep Champion: These are THE BEST for meal prep! Make on Sunday and reheat throughout the week. Storage: Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat from frozen in microwave for 60-90 seconds. Customization Ideas: Use whatever veggies you have! Mushrooms, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli all work great. Add different cheeses or herbs for variety. Make It Dairy-Free: Skip the cheese and use unsweetened almond milk."
