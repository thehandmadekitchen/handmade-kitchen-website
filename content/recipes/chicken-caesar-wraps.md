prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "0 minutes (with pre-cooked chicken)"
total_time: "15 minutes"
servings: "4 wraps"
ingredients:
  - "4 large whole wheat or spinach tortillas"
  - "2 cups cooked chicken breast, diced or shredded"
  - "4 cups chopped romaine lettuce"
  - "1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese"
  - "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt"
  - "2 tablespoons olive oil"
  - "1 tablespoon lemon juice"
  - "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard"
  - "2 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
  - "Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper until smooth."
  - "In a large bowl, toss together chicken, lettuce, and Parmesan cheese."
  - "Add dressing and toss until everything is well coated."
  - "Lay tortillas flat. Divide chicken mixture among the 4 tortillas, placing it in the center."
  - "Fold in the sides, then roll up tightly from bottom to top. Cut in half diagonally."
  - "Wrap in parchment paper or foil if packing for lunch."
notes: "Meal Prep: Prep all components separately and store in fridge. Assemble wraps fresh each morning (takes 2 minutes!) or night before. Rotisserie Shortcut: Use a store-bought rotisserie chicken to save time! Make It Lighter: Use lettuce wraps instead of tortillas for a low-carb option. Storage: Assembled wraps keep in fridge for 1 day. Store components separately for up to 4 days. Pro Tip: Don't overdress! Too much dressing makes wraps soggy. You can always pack extra dressing on the side."
