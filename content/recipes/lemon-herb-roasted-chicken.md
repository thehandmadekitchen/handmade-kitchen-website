instructions:

  - "Place chicken breast-side up on top of vegetables."

notes: "The Magic: While chicken roasts, vegetables underneath get crispy and soak up all the delicious drippings! Use Leftovers: Shred leftover chicken for salads, wraps, soup, quesadillas. Use for 3-4 meals! Make Stock: Save the bones! Simmer with vegetables for homemade chicken stock. Size Matters: Smaller chicken (3-4 lbs) = 50-60 minutes. Larger (5-6 lbs) = 75-90 minutes. Check Temperature: Always use meat thermometer! 165°F in thickest part of thigh. Crispy Skin Secret: DRY the chicken well before roasting! Moisture is the enemy of crispy skin."
