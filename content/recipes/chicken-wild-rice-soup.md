servings: "6-8 servings"
ingredients:
  - "2 tablespoons olive oil"
  - "1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced"
  - "1 onion, diced"
  - "3 carrots, diced"
  - "3 celery stalks, diced"
  - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "6 cups chicken broth"

  - "1 cup unsweetened coconut milk or regular milk"
  - "1 teaspoon dried thyme"
  - "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
  - "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add diced chicken and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside."
  - "In the same pot, add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 5 minutes until vegetables start to soften."
  - "Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant."
  - "Add chicken broth, wild rice, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil."
  - "Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25-30 minutes until rice is tender."

notes: "Meal Prep Hero: This soup actually tastes better the next day! Make a big batch and freeze portions for easy lunches. Time Saver: Use a rotisserie chicken and add it in the last 5 minutes to save time. The rice takes the longest, so that's what you're waiting for. Storage: Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Note: Rice will absorb liquid as it sits, so add extra broth when reheating. Make It Dairy-Free: Use coconut milk for a naturally dairy-free, creamy soup!"
