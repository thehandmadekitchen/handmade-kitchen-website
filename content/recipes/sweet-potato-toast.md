  - "While sweet potato toasts, prepare your toppings."
  - "Top warm sweet potato slices with your favorite combinations (see below) and serve immediately!"
notes: "3 Delicious Topping Combos: SAVORY: Mashed avocado, fried egg, everything bagel seasoning. SWEET: Almond butter, sliced banana, cinnamon, honey drizzle. MEDITERRANEAN: Hummus, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, feta, olive oil drizzle. Make Ahead: Toast sweet potato slices and store in fridge for up to 5 days. Pop in toaster to reheat! Pro Tip: If your toaster won't fit the slices, use the oven method instead. Storage: Keep plain toasted sweet potato in the fridge and add fresh toppings each morning."
