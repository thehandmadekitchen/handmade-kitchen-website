notes: "Press Firmly: The key to treats that hold together is REALLY pressing
  the mixture down hard! Variations: Add dried fruit, swap chocolate chips for
  butterscotch, use crunchy peanut butter for texture. Make It Fun: Press into
  shaped cookie cutters instead of squares for special occasions! Storage: Store
  in airtight container at room temperature for 5 days, or refrigerate for
  crispier treats. Nut-Free: Use sunflower seed butter instead of almond/peanut
  butter. Why It's Better: Honey instead of processed marshmallows, almond
  butter adds protein, brown rice cereal has more fiber!"
