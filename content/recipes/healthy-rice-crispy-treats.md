prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "5 minutes"
total_time: "15 minutes"
servings: "16 squares"
ingredients:
  - "6 cups brown rice cereal"
  - "1 cup honey"
  - "1 cup almond butter or peanut butter"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
  - "1/4 teaspoon salt"
  - "Optional: 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips"
instructions:
  - "Line a 9x13 pan with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray."
  - "Place cereal in a large bowl."
  - "In a saucepan over medium heat, combine honey and almond butter. Stir constantly until melted and smooth, about 3-4 minutes."
  - "Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and salt."
  - "Pour honey mixture over cereal and stir quickly until all cereal is coated."
  - "If using chocolate chips, stir them in now."
  - "Press mixture firmly into prepared pan. Use the back of a spatula or measuring cup."
  - "Let cool for 30 minutes before cutting into squares."
notes: "Press Firmly: The key to treats that hold together is REALLY pressing the mixture down hard! Variations: Add dried fruit, swap chocolate chips for butterscotch, use crunchy peanut butter for texture. Make It Fun: Press into shaped cookie cutters instead of squares for special occasions! Storage: Store in airtight container at room temperature for 5 days, or refrigerate for crispier treats. Nut-Free: Use sunflower seed butter instead of almond/peanut butter. Why It's Better: Honey instead of processed marshmallows, almond butter adds protein, brown rice cereal has more fiber!"
