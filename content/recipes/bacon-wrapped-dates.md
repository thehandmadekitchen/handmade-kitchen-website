prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "20 minutes"
total_time: "35 minutes"
servings: "24 pieces"
ingredients:
  - "24 Medjool dates, pitted"
  - "8 ounces bacon (about 12 strips)"
  - "4 ounces goat cheese or cream cheese"
  - "24 toothpicks"
  - "Optional: honey for drizzling, chopped nuts"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper."
  - "Cut each bacon strip in half lengthwise, then cut each strip into thirds (you'll have 24 pieces total)."
  - "Make a slit in each date. Stuff with about 1 teaspoon cheese."
  - "Wrap each stuffed date with one piece of bacon. Secure with toothpick."
  - "Arrange on baking sheet. Bake for 18-20 minutes, flipping halfway, until bacon is crispy."
  - "Let cool 5 minutes. Drizzle with honey if desired. Serve warm!"
notes: "The Combination: Sweet dates + salty bacon + creamy cheese = ADDICTIVE! Make Ahead: Assemble up to 24 hours ahead. Refrigerate. Bake when ready! Variations: Add almond inside date before wrapping, use blue cheese instead of goat cheese, or wrap in prosciutto for lighter option. Party Perfect: These are always the first appetizer to disappear! People love them. Dietary Note: Naturally gluten-free and keto-friendly (minus the dates' natural sugars). Serving Tip: Make LOTS. You can't eat just one!"
