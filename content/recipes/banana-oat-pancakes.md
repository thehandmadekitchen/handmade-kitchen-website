prep_time: "5 minutes"
cook_time: "10 minutes"
total_time: "15 minutes"
servings: "4 servings (about 12 small pancakes)"
ingredients:
  - "2 ripe bananas"
  - "2 eggs"
  - "1 cup old-fashioned oats"
  - "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)"
  - "Coconut oil or butter for cooking"
instructions:
  - "Add all ingredients to a blender. Blend for 30-45 seconds until smooth and well combined. Let batter sit for 2-3 minutes to thicken."
  - "Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of coconut oil or butter."
  - "Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes until bubbles form on top and edges look set."
  - "Flip carefully (these are delicate!) and cook another 1-2 minutes until golden brown."
  - "Serve warm with fresh berries, nut butter, or a drizzle of honey or maple syrup."
notes: "Make Ahead: Make a double batch and freeze! Place parchment paper between pancakes and freeze in a freezer bag for up to 3 months. Reheat in toaster or microwave. Pro Tips: Use very ripe (spotty) bananas for best sweetness. If batter is too thin, add more oats. If too thick, add a splash of milk. Variations: Add 1/4 cup blueberries or chocolate chips to batter before cooking. Storage: Refrigerate leftovers for 3-4 days. These reheat beautifully!"
