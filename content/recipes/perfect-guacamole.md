instructions:
  - "Cut avocados in half, remove pits, and scoop flesh into a bowl."

notes: "How to Pick Perfect Avocados: Ripe avocados yield to gentle pressure but aren't mushy. If buying ahead, buy firm ones and let ripen on counter for 2-3 days. Keep It Green: Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of guacamole to prevent browning. The lime juice also helps! Can't Eat Right Away?: Put the avocado pit back in the guacamole and cover tightly. This really does help prevent browning! Make It Spicier: Add more jalapeño or a dash of hot sauce. Customize It: Skip cilantro if you're not a fan. Add minced garlic for extra flavor!"
