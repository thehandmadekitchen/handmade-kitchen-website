prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "45 minutes"
total_time: "60 minutes"
servings: "16 bars"
ingredients:
  - "CRUST: 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 3/4 cup butter (cold)"
  - "FILLING: 4 eggs, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 2/3 cup fresh lemon juice, 1 tbsp lemon zest"
  - "Powdered sugar for dusting"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 9x13 pan with parchment paper (leave overhang for lifting)."
  - "Make crust: Mix flour and powdered sugar. Cut in cold butter until mixture is crumbly."
  - "Press mixture firmly into prepared pan. Bake for 18-20 minutes until lightly golden."
  - "While crust bakes, make filling: Whisk eggs, sugar, flour, lemon juice, and zest until smooth."
  - "Pour filling over hot crust. Return to oven."
  - "Bake for 22-25 minutes until filling is set but still slightly jiggly in center."
  - "Cool completely in pan. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours."
  - "Lift out using parchment. Dust generously with powdered sugar. Cut into bars."
notes: "Fresh Lemon is Key: Bottled lemon juice doesn't taste as good! Use fresh for best flavor. The Perfect Balance: Sweet buttery crust + tart lemon filling = heaven! Make Ahead: These are actually better the next day! Make 1-2 days ahead. Variations: Try lime bars, add fresh raspberries, or make meyer lemon version. Storage: Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 5 days. Serving Tip: Dust with powdered sugar right before serving for prettiest presentation."
