  - "2 celery stalks, finely diced"
  - "Salt and pepper to taste"

instructions:
  - "Boil eggs: Place eggs in pot, cover with cold water. Bring to boil, cover, remove from heat. Let sit 12 minutes. Transfer to ice bath."

Add Crunch: Finely diced pickles, red onion, or bell pepper add great texture. Make It Fancy: Serve on toasted bread with arugula and tomato. Storage: Keeps refrigerated for 3-4 days. Make Ahead: Perfect for meal prep! Serve Different Ways: Sandwiches, wraps, stuffed in tomatoes, over salad greens, with crackers."
