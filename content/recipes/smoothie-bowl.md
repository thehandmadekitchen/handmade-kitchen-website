notes: "Pro Tip: The key to a thick smoothie bowl is using FROZEN fruit and very little liquid. Start with less milk and add more if needed. Hidden Greens: Add a handful of spinach - you won't taste it but you'll get extra nutrients! Prep Ahead: Portion fruit into freezer bags for easy morning smoothie bowls. Topping Ideas: Make it fun! Let kids choose their own toppings. Try: sliced kiwi, mango, peanut butter drizzle, cacao nibs, hemp hearts, or homemade granola."
