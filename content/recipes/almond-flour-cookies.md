prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "12 minutes"
total_time: "22 minutes"
servings: "18 cookies"
ingredients:
  - "2 1/2 cups almond flour"
  - "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
  - "1/4 teaspoon salt"
  - "1/3 cup coconut oil, melted"
  - "1/3 cup honey or maple syrup"
  - "1 egg"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
  - "3/4 cup dark chocolate chips"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
  - "In a medium bowl, mix almond flour, baking soda, and salt."
  - "In a separate bowl, whisk together melted coconut oil, honey, egg, and vanilla until smooth."
  - "Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips."
  - "Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Flatten slightly with your palm."
  - "Bake for 10-12 minutes until edges are golden brown. Centers will look slightly underdone - that's perfect!"
  - "Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes (they'll firm up), then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
notes: "Why They're Better: Almond flour adds protein and healthy fats! These keep you satisfied longer than regular cookies. Texture Tip: Don't overbake! Remove when edges are golden but centers look soft. They'll firm up as they cool. Storage: Keep in an airtight container for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Make It Your Own: Try different mix-ins! Chopped nuts, dried cranberries, shredded coconut, or white chocolate chips. Gluten-Free: These are naturally gluten-free! Perfect for guests with dietary restrictions. Pro Tip: Use room temperature egg for easier mixing. Cold eggs make the coconut oil solidify!"
