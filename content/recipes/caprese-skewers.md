Find it in the vinegar aisle or make your own by simmering 1 cup balsamic vinegar until reduced by half. Party Tip: These are perfect for summer parties, BBQs, or as an appetizer before Italian dinner! Kid-Friendly: Even picky eaters love these! The sweet balsamic glaze wins them over. Variations: Add a grape tomato or cucumber slice for extra color. Use different types of fresh mozzarella for variety."
