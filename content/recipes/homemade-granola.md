prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "30 minutes"
total_time: "40 minutes"
servings: "8 cups"
ingredients:
  - "4 cups old-fashioned oats"
  - "1 cup nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts), chopped"
  - "1/2 cup seeds (sunflower, pumpkin)"
  - "1/2 cup coconut oil, melted"
  - "1/2 cup honey or maple syrup"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
  - "1 teaspoon cinnamon"
  - "1/2 teaspoon salt"
  - "1 cup dried fruit (add after baking!)"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper."
  - "In a large bowl, mix oats, nuts, seeds, cinnamon, and salt."
  - "In a small bowl, whisk together melted coconut oil, honey, and vanilla."
  - "Pour wet mixture over dry ingredients. Stir until everything is evenly coated."
  - "Spread mixture in an even layer on baking sheet. Press down gently."
  - "Bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until golden brown."
  - "Let cool COMPLETELY before breaking into clusters. Don't stir while cooling - that's how you get clusters!"
  - "Mix in dried fruit once completely cool."
  - "Store in airtight container for up to 3 weeks."
notes: "5 Flavor Variations: MAPLE PECAN - Use maple syrup, pecans, add 1/2 tsp maple extract. TROPICAL - Add coconut flakes, use cashews, add dried pineapple. CHOCOLATE - Add 1/4 cup cocoa powder, use chocolate chips instead of fruit. APPLE CINNAMON - Add 1/2 cup dried apples, extra cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. PEANUT BUTTER - Add 1/2 cup PB to wet ingredients, use peanuts. The Cluster Secret: Don't stir after removing from oven! Let it cool completely in one layer. Cost Comparison: Store-bought = $7-10 per bag. Homemade = $3-4. Huge savings! Perfect For: Breakfast over yogurt, snacking straight from the jar, gift giving in mason jars!"
