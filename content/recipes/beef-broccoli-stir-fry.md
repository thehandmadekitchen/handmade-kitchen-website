prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "15 minutes"
total_time: "30 minutes"
servings: "4 servings"
ingredients:
  - "1 pound flank steak, sliced thin against the grain"
  - "4 cups broccoli florets"
  - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated"
  - "3 tablespoons avocado oil"
  - "SAUCE: 1/3 cup coconut aminos or soy sauce, 2 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp cornstarch"
  - "Cooked rice for serving"
  - "Sesame seeds for garnish"
instructions:
  - "Make sauce: Whisk together coconut aminos, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Set aside."
  - "Pat beef very dry with paper towels. Cut into thin strips against the grain."
  - "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat until smoking."
  - "Add beef in a single layer. Cook 2 minutes without stirring. Flip and cook 1-2 minutes more. Remove to a plate."
  - "Add remaining oil. Add broccoli and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until tender-crisp."
  - "Add garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for 30 seconds."
  - "Return beef to pan. Pour in sauce. Toss for 1-2 minutes until sauce thickens."
  - "Serve over rice, garnished with sesame seeds!"
notes: "The Secret to Tender Beef: Slice AGAINST the grain, not with it. This is key! Make It Faster: Buy pre-cut stir-fry beef from the grocery store. Veggie Swap: Add snap peas, bell peppers, mushrooms, or baby corn. Why It's Better: Less sodium than takeout, no MSG, you control the oil, way cheaper! Cost Comparison: Takeout = $15-20. Homemade = $8-10. Meal Prep: Make extra sauce and prep vegetables ahead. Actual cooking takes 10 minutes!"
