Variations: Swap vegetables based on what you have - zucchini, carrots, sweet potatoes, and green beans all work great! Time Saver: Buy pre-cut vegetables to make this even faster. Cut vegetables into similar sizes so they cook evenly. Storage: Keeps in fridge for 4-5 days. Reheat in microwave or oven."
