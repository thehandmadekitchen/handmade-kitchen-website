prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "25 minutes"
total_time: "35 minutes"
servings: "16 brownies"
ingredients:
  - "1 can (15oz) black beans, drained and rinsed"
  - "3 eggs"
  - "1/3 cup cocoa powder"
  - "1/2 cup honey or maple syrup"
  - "1/4 cup coconut oil, melted"
  - "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
  - "1/2 teaspoon baking powder"
  - "1/2 teaspoon salt"
  - "1/2 cup chocolate chips"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F. Line an 8x8 pan with parchment paper and spray with oil."
  - "Add black beans, eggs, cocoa powder, honey, coconut oil, vanilla, baking powder, and salt to a food processor or blender."
  - "Blend for 2-3 minutes until completely smooth. Scrape down sides as needed."
  - "Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle chocolate chips on top."
  - "Bake for 22-25 minutes. Center should be slightly underdone (they firm as they cool)."
  - "Let cool completely in pan before cutting into squares."
notes: "The Secret Ingredient: Black beans add protein, fiber, and moisture - but you absolutely cannot taste them! Texture Tip: Slightly underbake for fudgier brownies. They'll firm up as they cool. Make Them Yours: Add walnuts, swirl in peanut butter, or use dark chocolate chips. Gluten-Free: Naturally gluten-free! Perfect for anyone avoiding gluten. Storage: Room temperature for 3 days, refrigerated for 1 week, freeze for 3 months. The Reveal: Don't tell people what's in them until AFTER they try one. Watch their faces!"
