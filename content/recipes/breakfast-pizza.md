notes: "Weekend Brunch Star: This is SO fun for weekend mornings or brunch with friends! Make Ahead: Assemble the night before, cover, refrigerate. Bake in the morning! Customization: Use sausage instead of bacon, add mushrooms, swap cheddar for Mexican cheese blend. Leftover Magic: This reheats beautifully! Make Sunday, eat Monday-Tuesday. Picky Eaters: Let kids choose their own toppings - they're more likely to eat it! Serve With: Fresh fruit salad on the side for a complete meal."
