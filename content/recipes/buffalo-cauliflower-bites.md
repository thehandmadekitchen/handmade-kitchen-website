prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "25 minutes"
total_time: "40 minutes"
servings: "6 servings"
ingredients:
  - "1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets"
  - "1/2 cup almond flour"
  - "1/2 cup water"
  - "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
  - "1/2 teaspoon salt"
  - "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
  - "1/2 cup buffalo sauce (Frank's RedHot works great)"
  - "2 tablespoons melted butter or olive oil"
  - "Ranch or blue cheese dressing for dipping"
  - "Celery sticks for serving"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
  - "In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, water, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to create a batter."
  - "Add cauliflower florets to batter and toss until all pieces are well coated."
  - "Arrange cauliflower in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes until golden."
  - "While cauliflower bakes, mix buffalo sauce with melted butter in a large bowl."
  - "Remove cauliflower from oven. Toss in buffalo sauce mixture until evenly coated."
  - "Return to baking sheet and bake for 5-7 more minutes until sauce is sticky and caramelized."
  - "Serve hot with ranch dressing and celery sticks!"
notes: "Game Day Winner: These disappear fast at parties! Even non-vegetarians can't get enough. Make It Spicier: Use extra hot buffalo sauce or add cayenne pepper to the batter. Make It Milder: Mix buffalo sauce with honey for a sweeter, less spicy version. Meal Prep: Bake plain cauliflower ahead, then toss in sauce and reheat when ready to serve. Storage: Best eaten fresh, but leftovers can be reheated in a 400°F oven for 5-10 minutes to crisp up. Pro Tip: Don't overcrowd the pan! Crowded cauliflower steams instead of crisping."
