notes: "Meal Prep Strategy: Make all three on Sunday! Different lunch every day. Rotisserie Shortcut: Buy cooked rotisserie chicken to save 20 minutes! Serve On: Bread, croissants, lettuce wraps, crackers, over greens, stuffed in avocado. Storage: Each version keeps 3-4 days refrigerated. Make in individual containers for grab-and-go! Feeding a Crowd: These are perfect for parties or potlucks. Set up a chicken salad bar! Budget Friendly: Use chicken thighs instead of breasts - cheaper and more flavorful!"
