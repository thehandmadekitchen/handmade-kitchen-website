prep_time: "5 minutes"
cook_time: "0 minutes"
total_time: "5 minutes + freezing time"
servings: "4 servings"
ingredients:
  - "4 ripe bananas, sliced and frozen"
  - "2-3 tablespoons milk of choice (only if needed)"
  - "Optional add-ins: cocoa powder, peanut butter, berries, vanilla extract"
instructions:
  - "Slice bananas and freeze in a single layer on a baking sheet for at least 2 hours or overnight."
  - "Add frozen banana slices to a high-powered blender or food processor."
  - "Blend on high, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. At first it will look crumbly, then suddenly it becomes creamy!"
  - "If mixture won't blend, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk at a time. But try without first - patience is key!"
  - "Once smooth and creamy like soft-serve ice cream, it's ready! Eat immediately for soft-serve texture."
  - "Or transfer to a container and freeze for 1-2 hours for a firmer, scoopable ice cream."
notes: "5 Flavor Variations: 1) CHOCOLATE: Add 2 tablespoons cocoa powder. 2) PEANUT BUTTER: Add 2 tablespoons peanut butter. 3) STRAWBERRY: Add 1 cup frozen strawberries. 4) MINT CHIP: Add 1/4 tsp peppermint extract and chocolate chips. 5) COOKIES & CREAM: Fold in crushed chocolate sandwich cookies. Pro Tip: Use VERY ripe bananas (lots of brown spots) for maximum sweetness! Make Ahead: Keep sliced bananas in freezer bags for instant nice cream anytime. Kid-Approved: They won't believe this is just bananas! It's a healthier dessert they'll actually love. Toppings: Try: chocolate chips, sprinkles, crushed nuts, honey drizzle, or fresh fruit."
