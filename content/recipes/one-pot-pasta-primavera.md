notes: "Why One-Pot?: Pasta cooks directly in the sauce, absorbing all the flavors! Plus easy cleanup. Veggie Flexibility: Use whatever vegetables you have! Mushrooms, spinach, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, or peas all work great. Add Protein: Stir in cooked chicken, shrimp, or white beans for extra protein. Storage: Keeps in fridge for 4 days. Reheats beautifully - add a splash of water when reheating. Kid Tip: The veggies blend into the sauce, making this perfect for picky eaters!"
