notes: "Meal Prep Perfection: This actually tastes better after sitting! The flavors marry together. Make on Sunday for lunches Monday-Friday. Add Protein: Toss in grilled chicken, shrimp, or hard-boiled eggs for extra protein. Make It Vegan: Skip the feta or use vegan feta. Still delicious! Storage: Keeps fresh in fridge for 5 days. The quinoa absorbs the dressing beautifully. Customization: This is super versatile! Add roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, or sun-dried tomatoes."
