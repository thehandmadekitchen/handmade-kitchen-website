instructions:
  - "Core and slice apples into thin rounds (about 1/4 inch thick). Arrange on a large plate or platter in a single layer, overlapping slightly."
  - "Warm almond butter in microwave for 15-20 seconds until it's drizzle-able (or thin with a teaspoon of water)."

notes: "Prevent Browning: Toss apple slices in a little lemon juice to keep them from browning if making ahead. Customizable: Let kids top their own! Set out bowls of different toppings and let them create. Other Topping Ideas: Raisins, chopped dates, chia seeds, hemp hearts, or crushed nuts. Quick Tip: This is perfect for after school or a fun weekend snack that feels like a treat but is actually nutritious!"
