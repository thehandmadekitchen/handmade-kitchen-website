notes: "Prevent Browning: Toss apple slices in a little lemon juice to keep them
  from browning if making ahead. Customizable: Let kids top their own! Set out
  bowls of different toppings and let them create. Other Topping Ideas: Raisins,
  chopped dates, chia seeds, hemp hearts, or crushed nuts. Quick Tip: This is
  perfect for after school or a fun weekend snack that feels like a treat but is
  actually nutritious!"
