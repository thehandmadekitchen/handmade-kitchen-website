total_time: "45 minutes"
servings: "6 servings (about 24 meatballs)"
ingredients:
  - "2 pounds ground turkey"
  - "1 cup finely grated zucchini (squeeze out water)"
  - "1/2 cup almond flour or whole wheat breadcrumbs"
  - "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese"
  - "2 eggs"
  - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning"
  - "1 teaspoon onion powder"
  - "1/2 teaspoon salt"
  - "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
  - "4 cups marinara sauce (store-bought or homemade)"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly spray with olive oil."
  - "Grate zucchini and squeeze out ALL the water using a clean kitchen towel. This step is crucial!"
  - "In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, zucchini, almond flour, Parmesan, eggs, garlic, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix gently with your hands until just combined."
  - "Roll mixture into 1.5-inch balls (about 2 tablespoons each). Place on prepared baking sheet."
  - "Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and cooked through (internal temp 165°F)."
  - "While meatballs bake, heat marinara sauce in a large pot over medium heat."
  - "Add baked meatballs to sauce and simmer for 5-10 minutes to let flavors blend."
  - "Serve over pasta, zucchini noodles, or in hoagie rolls for meatball subs!"
notes: "Freezer Meal Champion: Make a double batch! Freeze cooked meatballs in sauce for up to 3 months. Reheat from frozen. Meal Prep: These work for multiple meals! Spaghetti and meatballs Monday, meatball subs Tuesday, meatball soup Wednesday! Make It Dairy-Free: Skip the Parmesan or use nutritional yeast. Still delicious! Pro Tip: Wet your hands when rolling meatballs to prevent sticking. Storage: Refrigerate in sauce for up to 5 days. They actually taste better the next day!"
