notes: "Make Ahead: These keep for 2 weeks in the fridge! Make a double batch.
  Pro Tip: If dates are too dry, soak in warm water for 10 minutes first, then
  drain well. Variations: Roll into balls and coat with cocoa powder for
  'truffle' caramels, or add a pinch of vanilla extract. Storage: Keep
  refrigerated in an airtight container. They can also be frozen!"
