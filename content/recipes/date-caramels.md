prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "0 minutes"
total_time: "10 minutes + setting time"
servings: "20 caramels"
ingredients:
  - "2 cups Medjool dates, pitted (about 20-24 dates)"
  - "1/4 cup creamy almond butter"
  - "Flaky sea salt for topping"
instructions:
  - "Add pitted dates to a food processor. Process for 2-3 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides, until dates form a sticky ball."
  - "Add almond butter and process for another minute until smooth and creamy, like caramel!"
  - "Line a small baking dish (about 8x4) with parchment paper. Press date mixture firmly into the pan, smoothing the top."
  - "Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours until firm."
  - "Remove from pan and cut into small squares (about 20 pieces). Store in refrigerator."
notes: "Make Ahead: These keep for 2 weeks in the fridge! Make a double batch. Pro Tip: If dates are too dry, soak in warm water for 10 minutes first, then drain well. Variations: Roll into balls and coat with cocoa powder for 'truffle' caramels, or add a pinch of vanilla extract. Storage: Keep refrigerated in an airtight container. They can also be frozen!"
