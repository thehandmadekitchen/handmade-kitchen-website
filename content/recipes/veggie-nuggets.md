notes: "Freezer Friendly: These freeze beautifully! After baking and cooling,
  freeze in a single layer, then transfer to a freezer bag. Reheat from frozen
  at 350°F for 15 minutes. Meal Prep: Make a double batch on Sunday for easy
  lunchbox additions all week. Picky Eater Tip: The veggies are so finely grated
  that even veggie-haters won't notice them! Storage: Refrigerate for up to 4
  days or freeze for up to 3 months."
