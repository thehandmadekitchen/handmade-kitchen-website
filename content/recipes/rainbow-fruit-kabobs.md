notes: "Kid Involvement: Let kids make their own kabobs! They'll eat way more
  fruit this way. Safety Tip: For young kids, use blunt coffee stirrers or thick
  straws instead of pointy skewers. Fruit Flexibility: Use whatever fruit is in
  season! Melon, mango, oranges, raspberries all work. Party Perfect: Make these
  for birthday parties - kids love the rainbow colors! Make Ahead: Assemble
  kabobs 2-3 hours ahead, cover with damp paper towel, and refrigerate. Leftover
  Fruit: Chop and mix into yogurt parfaits or oatmeal!"
