notes: "Kid Involvement: Let kids make their own kabobs! They'll eat way more fruit this way. Safety Tip: For young kids, use blunt coffee stirrers or thick straws instead of pointy skewers. Fruit Flexibility: Use whatever fruit is in season! Melon, mango, oranges, raspberries all work. Party Perfect: Make these for birthday parties - kids love the rainbow colors! Make Ahead: Assemble kabobs 2-3 hours ahead, cover with damp paper towel, and refrigerate. Leftover Fruit: Chop and mix into yogurt parfaits or oatmeal!"
