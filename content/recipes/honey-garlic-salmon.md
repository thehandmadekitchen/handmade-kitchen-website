instructions:

  - "While vegetables roast, make glaze: Mix honey, remaining olive oil, garlic, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper."

notes: "Omega-3 Powerhouse: Salmon is packed with healthy fats! Serve 2-3 times per week for maximum benefits. Time Saver: Buy pre-washed Brussels sprouts and baby potatoes to save prep time. Meal Prep: Cook extra salmon to flake over salads for lunch the next day. Picky Eater Tip: If kids don't like salmon, substitute with chicken breasts (adjust cook time to 20-25 minutes). Storage: Best eaten fresh, but leftovers keep for 2 days in fridge. Reheat gently to avoid overcooking."
