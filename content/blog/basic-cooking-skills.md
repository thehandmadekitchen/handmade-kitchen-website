I couldn't cook for years. I was intimidated and overwhelmed.

Then I learned these 5 basic skills. Everything clicked!

Master these and you can cook ANYTHING.

## Skill 1: Knife Skills

**The Grip:**
- Pinch blade between thumb and index finger
- Wrap other fingers around handle
- Knuckles forward (protects fingers!)

**The Cut:**
- Use knuckles as guide
- Rock knife forward and down
- Keep tip on cutting board

**Practice On:** Onions (you'll use this skill daily!)

## Skill 2: Proper Seasoning

**The Rule:** Season in layers, taste as you go

**When to Season:**
- Beginning (while sautéing)
- Middle (while simmering)
- End (final adjustments)

**How Much:**
- Start with less
- Taste
- Add more
- Repeat

**Game Changer:** Food that actually tastes like something!

## Skill 3: Controlling Heat

**High Heat:**
- Searing meat
- Stir-frying
- Boiling water

**Medium-High:**
- Sautéing vegetables
- Pan-frying

**Medium:**
- Most everyday cooking
- Simmering

**Low:**
- Sauces
- Gentle cooking
- Warming

**Mistake:** Everything on high = burnt outside, raw inside!

## Skill 4: How to Sauté

**The Method:**
1. Heat pan first (2-3 minutes)
2. Add oil, wait until shimmering
3. Add food in single layer
4. Don't move it! (2-3 minutes)
5. Flip, cook other side

**Don't:**
- Overcrowd pan (food steams, doesn't brown)
- Stir constantly (needs time to brown!)
- Use cold pan (food sticks)

## Skill 5: Tasting and Adjusting

**The System:**
1. Taste
2. Identify what's missing
3. Add small amount
4. Taste again
5. Repeat

**What to Adjust:**
- **Bland?** → Add salt
- **Flat?** → Add acid (lemon, vinegar)
- **One-note?** → Add layers (herbs, spices)
- **Too salty?** → Add acid or sweet
- **Too acidic?** → Add fat or sweet

**This is HOW chefs cook!** Not following recipes exactly, but tasting and adjusting.

## Practice Plan

**Week 1:** Knife skills  
Practice dicing onions, mincing garlic

**Week 2:** Seasoning  
Cook 3 different dishes, season properly

**Week 3:** Heat control  
Sauté vegetables, sear meat

**Week 4:** Taste and adjust  
Make simple soup, adjust seasoning

**Week 5:** Combine all skills  
Cook full meal using everything!

## Why These Matter

**Before:** Following recipes exactly, food was mediocre

**After:** Understanding WHY = cooking with confidence

## The Confidence Factor

Once you master these:
- Recipes make sense
- You can improvise
- Food tastes better
- Cooking is fun!

## Resources

**Practice Recipes:**
- Sautéed vegetables (all skills!)
- Simple soup (seasoning + tasting)
- Pan-seared chicken (heat control)
- Stir-fry (knife skills + sautéing)

## Keep Learning

After mastering basics, try:
