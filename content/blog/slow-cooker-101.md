My slow cooker changed my life.

Seriously. Coming home to dinner already cooked? Game changer for busy families.

Here's everything you need to know.

## The Basics

**High vs. Low:**
- Low: 8 hours (while you're at work)
- High: 4 hours (afternoon cooking)
- Most recipes work either way!

**Size Matters:**
- 6-quart: Family of 4-6
- 4-quart: Couple or small family
- Fill 1/2 to 3/4 full for best results

## The Golden Rules

**Rule 1: Brown Meat First**
Sauté meat in skillet before slow cooker = better flavor

**Rule 2: Layer Correctly**
Hard vegetables (potatoes, carrots) on bottom  
Meat in middle  
Soft vegetables on top

**Rule 3: Don't Lift the Lid**
Every peek = 15-30 minutes added cook time!

**Rule 4: Less Liquid Than You Think**
Slow cooker traps moisture. Use 1/2 the liquid regular recipes call for.

## Best Proteins for Slow Cooker

**Perfect:**
- Chicken thighs (stays moist!)
- Pork shoulder
- Beef chuck roast
- Sausages

**Skip:**
- Chicken breasts (gets dry)
- Delicate fish
- Ground meat (unless browned first)

## 5 Must-Try Recipes

**1. Pulled Pork**
Pork shoulder + BBQ sauce. 8 hours low. Shred. Done!

**2. Pot Roast**
Chuck roast + potatoes + carrots + broth. 8 hours low.

**3. Chicken Tacos**
Chicken + salsa + taco seasoning. 6 hours low. Shred.

**4. Chili**
Everything in. 6-8 hours low. Easy!

**5. Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal**
Oats + milk + apples + cinnamon. Overnight. Wake to breakfast!

## Common Mistakes

**Too Much Liquid:** Leads to watery food

**Opening Lid:** Extends cook time significantly

**Wrong Cut of Meat:** Lean meats get dry

**Not Enough Time:** Tough meats need 6-8 hours

## Time-Saving Tricks

**Freezer Dump Bags:**
1. Label gallon bag with recipe name
2. Add all ingredients raw
3. Freeze flat
4. Dump frozen into slow cooker in morning

**Liners:** $0.10 each = no scrubbing!

**Double Batch:** Make 2, freeze 1

## What Works (And What Doesn't)

**Great Results:**
- Soups & stews
- Tough cuts of meat
- Beans & lentils
- Pasta sauces
- Breakfast casseroles

**Not Great:**
- Pasta (gets mushy)
- Dairy (curdles - add at end!)
- Crispy foods
- Delicate vegetables

## My Weekly Rotation

**Sunday:** Pot roast  
**Tuesday:** Chicken tacos  
**Thursday:** Chili

All started before work. Dinner waiting when I get home!

## Tips for Success

- Spray liner/pot with oil first
- Add fresh herbs in last 30 minutes
- Dairy goes in last 15 minutes
- Browning meat = worth the 5 minutes

## Investment Worth It?

**Cost:** $30-60  
**Saves:** Hours per week + takeout money

Absolutely worth it for busy families!
