We used to throw away $50+ of food every week. Wilted lettuce. Moldy berries. Mystery leftovers.

That's over $2,500 per year in the trash!

Then I implemented these 10 strategies. Our waste dropped by 75%. Here's how.

## 1. "Shop Your Fridge" First

Before grocery shopping, look at what you already have.

**My System:**
- Check fridge/freezer/pantry
- Plan meals using those ingredients FIRST
- Only buy what's actually needed

**Saves:** $30-40/week not buying duplicates

## 2. Store Produce Properly

Most food waste is produce that went bad too fast.

**The Right Way:**
- Berries: Wash in vinegar water, dry completely
- Lettuce: Wrap in damp paper towel
- Herbs: In water like flowers
- Tomatoes: Counter, never fridge
- Onions/potatoes: Separate (they make each other spoil!)

**Result:** Produce lasts 2-3x longer

## 3. Use Your Freezer

Freezer = pause button on food!

**Freeze These Before They Go Bad:**
- Overripe bananas (for smoothies/baking)
- Leftover cooked rice/grains
- Fresh herbs in olive oil (ice cube trays)
- Bread (toast from frozen)
- Cooked meat
- Vegetable scraps (for stock)

## 4. Eat Leftovers

$ave serious money here!

**My Rules:**
- Leftover night = Friday
- Label everything with date
- Visible storage (can't forget if you can't see it!)
- Repurpose (taco meat → taco salad → quesadilla)

## 5. Plan "Use It Up" Meals

Weekly flexible meal using whatever needs to be eaten:

**Examples:**
- Stir-fry (any vegetables!)
- Frittata (all the random leftovers)
- Soup (everything edible goes in)
- Grain bowl (assorted proteins + veggies)

## 6. Understand Dates

"Best By" ≠ "Expires"

**Dates Explained:**
- Best By: Peak quality (still safe after!)
- Use By: Freshness date
- Sell By: Store rotation (you have time!)

**Trust your senses:** Smell, look, taste (small bite)

## 7. Compost

Can't eat it? Compost it!

**Even Apartment Dwellers:**
- Counter compost bin
- Freeze scraps (no smell!)
- Drop at farmers market compost
- Or get worm bin (seriously!)

**Why:** Feels better than trashing

## 8. Love Your Leftovers

Make them appealing:

**Leftover Makeovers:**
- Roast chicken → chicken salad → quesadilla
- Rice → fried rice → rice balls
- Vegetables → frittata → soup

**Storage:** Glass containers (see what's inside!)

## 9. Buy Imperfect Produce

"Ugly" food tastes the same!

**Options:**
- Imperfect Foods/Misfits Market delivery
- Farmers market end-of-day deals
- Store discount rack

**Savings:** 30-50% off regular price

## 10. Track What You Throw Away

**For 1 Week:**
- Note everything you throw out
- Estimate cost
- Identify patterns

**Adjust:** Stop buying what you always waste

## The Impact

**Our Numbers:**
- Before: $200+/month wasted
- After: $50/month wasted
- **Annual Savings:** $1,800!

Plus environmental impact!

## Start With 3

Pick 3 strategies this week:
1. Store produce properly
2. Freeze before spoiling
3. Plan use-it-up meal

Small changes = big impact!
