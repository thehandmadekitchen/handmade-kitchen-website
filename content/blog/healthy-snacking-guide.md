3pm hits. You're starving. You grab chips, cookies, whatever's easy.

Then you're hungry again in an hour. Plus you feel terrible.

Here's how to snack smart - satisfying, healthy, and actually keeps you full!

**Example:**
- Apple (fiber) + almond butter (protein + fat)
- Carrots (fiber) + hummus (protein + fat)
- Greek yogurt (protein) + berries (fiber) + nuts (fat)

**Why It Works:** Slows digestion, stabilizes blood sugar
