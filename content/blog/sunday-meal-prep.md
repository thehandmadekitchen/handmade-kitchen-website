There was a time when weeknight dinners felt like a constant scramble. By 5pm, I'd realize we had nothing planned, resort to takeout or throw together whatever random ingredients I could find, and feel guilty about it.

Then I discovered Sunday meal prep, and everything changed.

I'm not talking about cooking seven different meals and eating the same thing all week. I'm talking about smart prep work that makes weeknight cooking actually enjoyable instead of stressful.

Here's my exact Sunday routine.

## Sunday Morning: The Planning Session (15 minutes)

Before I do ANY cooking, I plan. This is the most important step!

**What I Do:**
1. Check my calendar for the week - what nights are busy?
2. Plan 4-5 dinners (not seven - give yourself grace!)
3. Check what ingredients I already have
4. Make a detailed grocery list
5. Order groceries online or plan a store trip

**My Planning Template:**
- Monday: Quick meal (under 30 minutes)
- Tuesday: Slow cooker or one-pot meal
- Wednesday: Family favorite
- Thursday: Sheet pan or oven meal
- Friday: Leftovers or pizza night
- Weekend: More relaxed cooking or eating out

The key: Match meal complexity to your schedule. Save the quick meals for your busiest nights!

## Sunday Afternoon: The Prep Work (2-3 hours)

This is where the magic happens. I do this while listening to podcasts or music - it's actually become "me time" that I look forward to!

### Step 1: Wash & Prep Vegetables (30 minutes)

**What I Prep:**
- Wash and chop all vegetables for the week
- Store in glass containers with damp paper towels
- Pre-portion snack veggies (carrots, bell peppers, cucumbers)

**Time Savers:**
- Buy pre-washed greens and pre-cut vegetables when budget allows
- Use a salad spinner - makes greens last longer
- Prep hardy vegetables first (carrots, bell peppers) - they last longest

**What I Don't Pre-Cut:** Avocados, tomatoes, and mushrooms - these don't store well pre-cut.

### Step 2: Cook Protein in Bulk (45 minutes)

This is the game-changer! Having cooked protein ready to go makes weeknight meals SO much easier.

**My Go-To Proteins:**
- Grilled chicken breasts (use for salads, wraps, bowls)
- Ground turkey or beef (tacos, pasta sauce, grain bowls)
- Hard-boiled eggs (snacks, breakfast, salads)
- Rotisserie chicken from store (cheating allowed!)

**How I Cook It:**
- Chicken: Season and bake at 400°F for 25 minutes
- Ground meat: Brown in large skillet with seasonings
- Eggs: Instant Pot or stovetop - make a dozen at once

Store cooked proteins in glass containers. They last 4-5 days refrigerated.

### Step 3: Cook Grains & Beans (30 minutes)

Having these ready means I can throw together grain bowls, soups, or sides in minutes.

**What I Prep:**
- 2-3 cups cooked quinoa or brown rice
- 2 cans beans (drain, rinse, and portion)
- Sometimes pasta if I know we're having it

**Pro Tip:** Cook grains in broth instead of water for extra flavor!

### Step 4: Make 1-2 Sauces or Dressings (15 minutes)

Homemade dressings and sauces make everything taste better and keep for a week.

**My Weekly Staples:**
- Big batch of salad dressing
- Marinara sauce for pasta night
- Taco seasoning mix in a jar
- Pesto or chimichurri for easy flavor

These turn boring ingredients into delicious meals!

### Step 5: Prep Breakfast & Snacks (30 minutes)

**What I Make:**
- Overnight oats (5 jars for weekday breakfasts)
- Egg muffins or frittata for grab-and-go breakfast
- Energy bites or cut fruit for snacks
- Portion nuts and seeds into small containers

Morning me is SO grateful to Sunday me for this!

## What My Fridge Looks Like After Prep

Everything is washed, chopped, cooked, and stored in clear glass containers. I can SEE what I have, which means:
- Less food waste
- Faster dinner prep
- Healthier choices (when healthy food is ready to eat, I eat it!)
- Less stress

## How This Changed My Week

**Monday:**
Throw together a quinoa bowl with pre-cooked chicken, prepped veggies, and homemade dressing. Dinner in 10 minutes!

**Tuesday:**
Toss slow cooker chicken tacos ingredients in the morning. Come home to dinner ready.

**Wednesday:**
Sheet pan dinner with chicken and veggies - already prepped, just season and roast.

**Thursday:**
Use leftover chicken in wraps or turn ground turkey into quick tacos.

**Friday:**
Leftovers, pizza, or something fun!

## Tips for Success

**Start Small:** Don't try to do everything at once. Start with just prepping vegetables and cooking one protein. Add more as you get comfortable.

**Get the Family Involved:** My kids help wash vegetables and portion snacks. It goes faster and they're learning!

**Invest in Good Containers:** Glass containers with snap lids are worth every penny. I can see what's inside and they last forever.

**Make It Enjoyable:** Put on music, pour yourself a drink, listen to a podcast. This is YOUR time.

**Be Flexible:** Some weeks I prep more, some weeks less. Do what works for your schedule.

## What If I Don't Have 3 Hours?

Even 30 minutes of prep makes a difference! Choose the tasks that will help most:
- 30 minutes: Wash and chop vegetables
- 45 minutes: Add cooking one protein
- 1 hour: Add prepping breakfast
- 2 hours: Add grains and sauces
- 3 hours: Do everything!

## The Real Impact

Meal prep has given me:
- **More time with family** (not rushing through dinner prep)
- **Less stress** (no more 5pm panic)
- **Healthier eating** (when healthy food is convenient, we eat it)
- **Less food waste** (we use everything we buy)
- **More money** (way less takeout!)

It's not about being perfect or having every meal planned. It's about setting yourself up for success during the busy week ahead.

Want to try it? Pick ONE thing from this list to prep next Sunday. Just one! See how it feels, then add more as you go.
