Our grocery bill used to be $300/week. For a family of 4!

Now? $150/week for the same family. Same quality food.

Here are the 12 strategies that cut our bill in half.

## Strategy 1: Never Shop Hungry

Hungry shopping = impulse buying

**Solution:** Eat before shopping. Always!

**Saves:** $20-30 per trip on junk you don't need

## Strategy 2: Shop with a List (And Stick to It!)

**My List Method:**
- Organized by store layout
- Only what's on list goes in cart
- No exceptions (okay, maybe chocolate)

## Strategy 3: Know Your Prices

Track prices of items you buy regularly.

**Price Book Method:**
- Note regular price
- Only buy on sale
- Stock up when cheap

**Example:** Chicken normally $4/lb, on sale $2/lb → buy 10 lbs, freeze!

## Strategy 4: Shop Sales + Stock Up

**The System:**
- Plan meals around what's on sale
- When staples are cheap, buy LOTS
- Use coupons on already-sale items

**Stock Up Items:**
- Meat (freeze!)
- Canned goods
- Pasta
- Rice
- Frozen vegetables

## Strategy 5: Store Brands = Same Quality

**Comparison:**
- Name brand cereal: $5
- Store brand: $2.50
- **Same factory often!**

**Exceptions:** Items where brand really matters to you

## Strategy 6: Buy in Bulk (Smart Items Only)

**Worth Buying Bulk:**
- Meat (portion and freeze)
- Rice, oats, flour
- Nuts and seeds
- Spices
- Paper goods

**Not Worth Bulk:**
- Perishables you won't use
- Items you've never tried
- Things you rarely use

## Strategy 7: Seasonal Produce

**In Season = Cheap + Delicious**

**Example:**
- Summer strawberries: $2/lb
- Winter strawberries: $6/lb

**Solution:** Buy in season, freeze for later!

## Strategy 8: Shop Multiple Stores

**My Route:**
- Aldi: Staples, dairy, produce
- Regular grocery: Sales items
- Costco: Bulk meat monthly

**Saves:** $50+/week vs. one-stop shopping

## Strategy 9: Meal Plan Before Shopping

**Process:**
1. Check what you have
2. Plan 5-7 dinners
3. Make list from meal plan
4. ONLY buy what's on list

**Prevents:** Buying random items that don't make meals

## Strategy 10: Avoid Pre-Cut/Pre-Packaged

**The Markup:**
- Whole chicken: $1.29/lb
- Chicken breasts: $3.99/lb
- Pre-cut vegetables: 2-3x more expensive

**Solution:** Buy whole, cut yourself. 5 minutes = $10 saved!

## Strategy 11: Use Frozen When Cheaper

**Frozen is Often:**
- Cheaper
- Just as nutritious
- Longer-lasting
- Less waste

**Buy Frozen:**
- Berries (smoothies, baking)
- Vegetables (cooking)
- Meat (bulk)

## Strategy 12: Cash Envelope System

**How It Works:**
- Withdraw grocery budget in cash
- When it's gone, it's gone
- Forces you to stick to budget

**Psychology:** Spending cash hurts more than card

## What I Always Buy

**Never Skimp:**
- Eggs
- Olive oil
- Real butter
- Fresh fruit

**Always Buy Cheap:**
- Pasta
- Rice
- Canned goods
- Frozen vegetables

## Sample Shopping Trip

**Total:** $147
- Aldi (80%): $118
- Regular store (sales): $29

**Meal Plan:** 7 dinners + breakfasts + lunches

## The Results

**Before:** $300/week ($15,600/year)  
**After:** $150/week ($7,800/year)  
**SAVINGS:** $7,800/year!

**What Changed:** Nothing except strategy!
