Cooking dinner every single night was exhausting.

Then I discovered batch cooking. Now I cook once, eat 4-5 meals from it.

Here's my exact system.

## What is Batch Cooking?

**Concept:** Cook large quantities, use multiple ways throughout week

**Not the same as:** Meal prep (cooking complete meals) or freezer meals

**Example:** Roast whole chicken Sunday → shredded chicken wraps Monday → chicken soup Tuesday → chicken quesadillas Wednesday

## The 3 Batch Cooking Methods

### Method 1: Base Proteins

Cook proteins in bulk, use different ways:

**Batch 1: Shredded Chicken**
- Sunday: Roast whole chicken
- Monday: Chicken Caesar salad
- Tuesday: Chicken tacos
- Wednesday: Chicken noodle soup

**Batch 2: Ground Beef**
- Sunday: Brown 3 lbs ground beef
- Monday: Tacos
- Tuesday: Spaghetti sauce
- Thursday: Stuffed peppers

### Method 2: Component Cooking

Cook components, mix and match:

**Cook:**
- 3 cups rice
- 3 cups quinoa
- 2 lbs roasted vegetables
- 3 lbs protein

**Combine:** Different combinations each night!

### Method 3: Big Batch Meals

Make huge portions, eat or freeze:

**Examples:**
- Chili (eat 2 nights, freeze rest)
- Lasagna (2 pans - one now, one freeze)
- Soup (eat 3 days, freeze portions)

## My Sunday Routine (2-3 Hours)

**Hour 1:**
- Roast whole chicken (75 min in oven)
- While chicken roasts: Brown ground meat
- Cook rice and quinoa

**Hour 2:**
- Roast 4 sheet pans of vegetables
- Make one big batch recipe (chili, soup, etc.)
- Prep vegetables for week

**Hour 3:**
- Portion everything
- Label containers
- Clean kitchen

## The Best Proteins to Batch Cook

**Chicken:**
- Whole roasted
- Breasts (grill or bake)
- Thighs (versatile!)

**Ground Meat:**
- Beef
- Turkey
- Pork

**Pork:**
- Slow cooker pulled pork
- Tenderloin
- Chops

**Beans:**
- Cook from dried
- Way cheaper!
- Freeze portions

## The Best Sides to Batch Cook

**Grains:**
- Rice (white, brown, wild)
- Quinoa
- Pasta (slightly undercook!)

**Vegetables:**
- Roasted vegetables
- Steamed broccoli
- Sautéed greens

## Storage Tips

**Containers:**
- Glass (see what's inside!)
- Portion-sized (grab and go)
- Label with contents + date

**Refrigerator:**
- Front = use first
- Back = use later
- Stack by day

**Freezer:**
- Flat bags (save space!)
- Label everything
- Use within 3 months

## My Weekly Plan

**Sunday Prep:**
- 1 whole chicken
- 2 lbs ground turkey
- 3 cups rice
- 4 sheet pans roasted vegetables

**Meals from This:**
- Monday: Chicken bowls
- Tuesday: Turkey tacos
- Wednesday: Chicken soup
- Thursday: Turkey pasta
- Friday: Leftovers or easy meal

## Time Investment vs. Savings

**Sunday Investment:** 2-3 hours

**Weeknight Savings:**
- Monday-Thursday: 45 min each night
- Total: 3 hours saved!

**Net Savings:** 30-60 minutes!

Plus: No weeknight stress!

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Cooking too much variety  
**Solution:** Stick to 2-3 proteins

**Mistake 2:** Not labeling  
**Solution:** Label everything!

**Mistake 3:** Making food you don't like  
**Solution:** Only batch cook favorites

**Mistake 4:** Storing poorly  
**Solution:** Invest in good containers

## Start Small

**Week 1:** Batch cook just ONE protein  
**Week 2:** Add grains  
**Week 3:** Add vegetables  
**Week 4:** Full batch cooking!

Build the habit gradually!

## The Results

**Before batch cooking:**
- Cooked every night (45 min)
- Stressed at 5pm
- Takeout 2-3x/week

**After batch cooking:**
- "Cook" 15 min (assemble!)
- Relaxed evenings
- Takeout rare

**Life-changing!**
