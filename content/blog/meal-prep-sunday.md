Sunday meal prep doesn't have to be complicated. Here's my simple routine:

## 1. Plan the Week (15 minutes)
Write down 5 dinner ideas. That's it. Not 7 - just 5. The other nights are for leftovers or simple scrambles.

## 2. Grocery Shop (45 minutes)
Order online or hit the store with your list. Stick to the perimeter - produce, meat, dairy.

## 3. Prep Basics (1 hour)
- Wash and chop vegetables
- Cook a batch of rice or quinoa
- Bake a tray of chicken
- Hard boil eggs

That's it! You're set for the week.
