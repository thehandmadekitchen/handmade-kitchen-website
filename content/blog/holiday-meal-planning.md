My first Thanksgiving was a disaster. Turkey was dry, sides were cold, I cried in the kitchen.

Now? I host 20 people with ease! Here's my complete system.

## The Master Timeline

**2 Weeks Before:**
- Plan menu
- Make shopping list
- Order turkey
- Plan table setting

**1 Week Before:**
- Shop for non-perishables
- Make freezable items
- Deep clean kitchen
- Confirm guest count

**2 Days Before:**
- Final grocery shop
- Thaw turkey
- Make cranberry sauce
- Bake pies

**1 Day Before:**
- Prep vegetables
- Make casseroles (don't bake yet!)
- Set table
- Make stuffing

**Day Of:**
- Morning: Turkey in oven
- Afternoon: Bake sides
- 1 hour before: Final touches

**Stress Level:** Minimal!

## The Menu Planning Formula

**Pick:**
- 1 turkey/main
- 3-4 side dishes
- 1 vegetable
- 2 desserts
- 1-2 appetizers

**Don't:** Make 15 dishes! Keep it manageable.

## What to Make Ahead

**Days/Weeks Before:**
- Cranberry sauce (freeze!)
- Pie crusts
- Rolls (freeze unbaked)
- Stocks/broths

**Day Before:**
- Mashed potatoes (reheat with cream)
- Casseroles (bake day-of)
- Pie filling
- Chopped vegetables

**Morning Of:**
- Appetizers
- Salads (don't dress!)
- Set buffet

## Turkey Timeline

**15-pound turkey:**
- Thaw: 3-4 days in fridge
- Roast: 3-4 hours at 325°F
- Rest: 30 minutes

**Start turkey FIRST!**

Everything else times around it.

## The Day-Of Schedule

**6am:** Turkey in oven

**9am:** Make appetizers

**10am:** Prep final sides

**11am:** Set table

**12pm:** Start sides in oven

**2pm:** Turkey out, resting

**2:30pm:** Final reheating, gravy

**3pm:** SERVE!

## Delegation is Key

**Assign Dishes:**
- Aunt makes pie
- Sister brings rolls
- Friend brings appetizer

**You Make:** Turkey + 2-3 sides

**Result:** Manageable!

## Keep It Warm

**Holding Food:**
- Warm oven (200°F)
- Slow cookers
- Chafing dishes
- Covered dishes

**Tip:** Everything won't be piping hot. That's okay!

## Setting Up Buffet

**Flow:**
1. Plates
2. Turkey
3. Sides
4. Utensils
5. Napkins

**Keep:** Heavy items first

**Skip:** Cramming everything on table

## The Clean-Up Plan

**During Party:**
- Rinse and stack dishes
- Clear as you go
- Load dishwasher between courses

**After:**
- Guests help!
- Pack leftovers
- Soak pots overnight

**Next Day:** Final deep clean

## My Favorite Make-Ahead Sides

1. **Green Bean Casserole** - Assemble day before, bake day-of
2. **Sweet Potato Casserole** - Same!
3. **Stuffing** - Make day before, warm in oven
4. **Cranberry Sauce** - Make days ahead
5. **Rolls** - Freeze unbaked, bake fresh

## Leftover Strategy

**Containers Ready:**
- Have storage containers out
- Label with guest names
- Send everyone home with food

**Keep for Yourself:**
- Turkey for soup
- Stuffing for breakfast hash
- Mashed potatoes for shepherd's pie

## Budget-Friendly Tips

**Save Money:**
- Store brand staples
- Make from scratch
- Shop sales weeks ahead
- Accept help (potluck style!)

**Cost Comparison:**
- Restaurant: $40+/person
- Homemade: $10-15/person

## For First-Timers

**Simplify!**
- Buy pre-made pie
- Use bag stuffing
- Keep guest list small
- Don't try new recipes

**Build confidence gradually!**

## My Current System

**I Make:**
- Turkey
- 2 sides
- Gravy

**Family Brings:**
- 2 sides
- All desserts
- Appetizers

**Guests:** 20  
**Stress:** Low  
**Success:** High!

## The Secret

**It's not about perfection!**

It's about:
- Being together
- Good food
- Making memories

**No one remembers:** If the turkey was 5 minutes late

**Everyone remembers:** Laughing together
