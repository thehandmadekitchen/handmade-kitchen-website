Remove when edges are golden but centers look soft. They'll firm up as they cool. Storage: Keep in an airtight container for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Make It Your Own: Try different mix-ins! Chopped nuts, dried cranberries, shredded coconut, or white chocolate chips. Gluten-Free: These are naturally gluten-free! Perfect for guests with dietary restrictions. Pro Tip: Use room temperature egg for easier mixing. Cold eggs make the coconut oil solidify!"

Can't Eat Right Away?: Put the avocado pit back in the guacamole and cover tightly. This really does help prevent browning! Make It Spicier: Add more jalapeño or a dash of hot sauce. Customize It: Skip cilantro if you're not a fan. Add minced garlic for extra flavor!"

      "excerpt": "Stop trying to plan 21 different dinners. Here's why rotating just 5",
      "content": "I used to spend hours every Sunday planning elaborate weekly menus. Different meals every night, impressive recipes to try, variety for variety's sake. And you know what? I was exhausted before the week even started.\n\n## The Problem With Too Much Variety\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about meal planning: your brain doesn't actually want to make 21 different decisions every week. Decision fatigue is real, and dinner decisions are depleting your willpower for more important things.\n\nThe 5-Meal Framework is simple: Choose 5 dinners that your family will eat without complaint. That's it. Rotate them every week. Same meals, same shopping list, zero mental gymnastics.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- **Monday:** Tacos (because starting the week with something everyone likes sets the tone)\n- **Tuesday:** Sheet pan chicken with roasted vegetables  \n- **Wednesday:** Pasta night (rotate the sauce if you want variety)\n- **Thursday:** Breakfast for dinner (pancakes, eggs, whatever)\n- **Friday:** Homemade pizza or leftovers\n\nThe beauty is in the repetition. After a few weeks, you don't even need to think about what to buy. You know exactly what's on the list. Your kids know what to expect. Everyone's stress level drops.\n\n## But What About Boredom?\n\nHere's the thing: you can still have variety within the framework. Tacos can be beef, chicken, or fish. Sheet pan dinners rotate vegetables by season. Pasta sauce changes. But the basic structure stays the same.\n\nAnd honestly? After implementing this, I realized we were never eating as much \"variety\" as I thought we were. We had favorite meals that showed up repeatedly anyway—I was just making it harder on myself by pretending we needed something different every single night.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nLook at what you've made in the last month. Which 5 meals did everyone eat without drama? Start there. Don't overthink it. You can always swap one out later if it's not working.\n\nThe goal isn't perfection. It's sustainability. And a framework that actually works on a random Tuesday when you're running on four hours of sleep.",
